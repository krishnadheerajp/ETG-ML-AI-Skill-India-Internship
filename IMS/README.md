# Inventory Management System
This is a simple inventory management system which is able to perform all the CRUD operations on the given inventory. The IMS.ipynb file is for the operations to be performed on the inventory by Admin. The IMS_User.ipynb can be used by the Sales Incharge to record the purchases made by each user. The inventory.json file contains the details of all the items present in the inventory and the sales.json file contains all the details of the purchases made by the user.
