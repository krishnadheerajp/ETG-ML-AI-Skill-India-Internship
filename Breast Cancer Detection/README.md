# Breast Cancer Detection

This is a simple breast cancer detection model using neural networks. The data is present in sklearn datasets, for using layers and models Keras library is used.

First, the data is analyzed to understand more about features and its target values. Then, the data is scaled using Standard Scaler to fit in the model.

Next, the scaled data is divided for training, validation and testing purposes. Then, the model is created into the layers and reLU activation is used in the input and hidden layer, sigmoid function is used at the end to obtain the resulting value in the output layer.

At last, the model is trained using 10 epochs and batch size of 1 and the accuracy is verified using the validation data. When the data is tested it has a great score of 97% which indicates that our model is successful. We can try to improve even more by varying the epochs, adding more layers, using different activation functions, etc.
